These are the "randomly" generated problems.

The configuartion for problems depends on the size; however, the size of the grid is fixed, it is 20x30.

Other variables like speed, and correspondingly the distance between points, are chosen so that process time and traveling time are considerably close. As if the former dominated then the answer would be trivial (it would be the sum of the process times), and if the latter dominated this problem would practically reduce to regular TSP.

Further calculation of the parameters are also mentioned in the script as comments, and when repeating the exam be sure to adjust the SPEED variable accordingly.

The problems in these documents are given in the format:
(Pointi_x_coordinate, Point_i_y_coordinate, Point_i_process_time)

The parser for these problems are also provided in the script, feel free to generate more problems with the generate.py script.
